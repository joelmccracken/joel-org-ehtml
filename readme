git submodule init
git submodule update

---- notes

- theoretical arch would be to have https through two containers
  - nginx docker container (has https)
  - emacs docker container
    - emacs
    - org
    - ehtml
    - deps
    - git, for committing
    - filesystem access (org files, git commits)
- js file is broken -- seems like html export has changed (no more "content begin/end" markers) not a whole lot to keep here
- going to need to fixup secrets script before this could really be deployed "correctly"
  - need to git check out/push private org files
  - need to get username/password for http auth(may not really need secret script, but why not?)
